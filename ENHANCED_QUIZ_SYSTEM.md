  - **Correct on first try**: X/Y questions
  - **Total Retries**: Total failed attempts across all questions

### ‚úÖ 6. Keyboard Shortcuts

.quiz-option.attempting {
    background: #95a5a6;
    color: white;
    border-color: #95a5a6;
    transform: scale(0.98);
}

/* Revealed correct answer */
.quiz-option.revealed-correct {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f093fb 0%, #f5576c 100%);
    animation: pulse 2s infinite;
}

/* Hint container */
.hint-container {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fff3cd 0%, #ffeaa7 100%);

}

}
```

## JavaScript Architecture

### New Classes:
1. **HintManager** (`app.js`)
   - `showHint(questionKey, attemptCount)`: Display hints based on attempts
   - `showRevealButton(questionKey)`: Show reveal after 6 attempts
   - `clearHints()`: Remove hints when question answered

2. **KeyboardManager** (`screen-manager.js`)
   - Handles all keyboard shortcuts
   - Smart detection of interactive content
   - `enable()` / `disable()` methods

### Enhanced Functions:
1. **checkAnswerFullScreen()** - Completely refactored
   - Tracks first attempts
   - Shows progressive hints
   - No visual feedback until correct
   - Enhanced overlay with question + answer

2. **checkCityMatch()** - Updated for city matching
   - Same hint/reveal system
   - Tracks all 16 cities individually
   - Aggregate Module 2 scoring

3. **generateCertificate()** - Accurate scoring
   - Uses `firstAttempts` for accuracy calculation
   - Shows X/Y correct on first try
   - Displays first-try accuracy percentage

## Data Structures

### Tracking Objects:
```javascript
// Total retries per question (for certificate display)
let retries = {
    module1: 0,
    module2: 0,
    module3_q1: 0,
    // ... etc
};

// First attempt results (true/false/null)
let firstAttempts = {
    module1: null,
    module2: null,
    module3_q1: null,
    // ... etc
};

// Attempt counter per question
let questionAttempts = {
    // Dynamically populated as questions are answered
};
```
