- **Total questions**: 28 across all modules
- **First-attempt accuracy** rewarded
- **Displayed on certificate** alongside retries

### 11. **A4-Optimized Certificate** ✅
- **Print settings**:
  ```css
  @page {
    size: A4;
    margin: 10mm;
  }
  ```
- **Certificate dimensions**: 190mm width (fits A4 with margins)
- **Responsive font sizing** for print
- **Four statistics displayed**:
  1. Total Points Earned
